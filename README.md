# liri-node-app
In this application we will make an application called LIRI. LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. We will use the APIs from Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB to callback information from the command line.
